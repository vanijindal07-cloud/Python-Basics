#  Python Basics (Data Cleaning)

## Objective
The objective of this task is to perform basic data cleaning using Python
and Pandas, demonstrating how Python can be used instead of Excel for
handling real-world datasets.

## Dataset
Titanic Dataset (CSV format)

## Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Steps Performed
- Loaded the dataset using pandas
- Explored the dataset using head() and info()
- Identified missing values
- Filled missing numeric values using mean
- Filled missing categorical values using mode
- Removed irrelevant columns with excessive missing data
- Removed duplicate records
- Converted datatypes for correct analysis
- Created a new column using conditional logic
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file

## Files Included
- Task5_Cleaning.ipynb
- cleaned_data.csv

## Outcome
This task helped in understanding basic data cleaning techniques and
demonstrated how Python simplifies data preprocessing for analytics.
